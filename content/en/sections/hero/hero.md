I've been working on IT projects for over 10 years. React and the modern frontend world are my passion. 
I started my career in project management but noticed over the years that due to my technical background, I'm happier being a software engineer and since then have been working successfully as a frontend developer. 
In some projects, I took over the responsibility to lead a whole team, including frontend architecture design and was a part of an agile team building successful products.
In myself, you will find a proven expert in building performant and elegant applications (SPA) with React and JavaScript for your project.
